By providing the url of the title or episode page of a series, the ratings of all seasons is returned.

## Rudimentary python project to allow basic web scraping of IMDb episode ratings.

In the "\_\_main\_\_" section, replace the value of the variable "url" with the url of the desired series. Either the title page or the episode page of season 1 can be provided. An array of arrays will be returned. This may be useful, as it may be subsequently used to create graphs with numerous libraries.
